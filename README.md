# PairTrading

Learned how to do it from Auquan tutorials. 


According to Quantopia it can be more optimized by using:
Augmented-Dickey Fuller test, Hurst exponent, Half-life of mean reversion inferred from an Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process and Kalman filters.

I did not check for Cointegration as I took conintegrated stocks namely Walmart and Target. You can check whether the stocks you chose are cointegarated or not by using coint from statsmodels.tsa.stattools
